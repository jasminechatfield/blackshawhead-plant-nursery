## About Blackshawhead Plant Nursery

Blackshawhead Plant Nursery came into being partly as an antidote to our nearest
large-scale garden centres which seem to sell very expensive plants imported from
Holland, alongside a vast range of gaudy tat (which of course has its place!). In
addition, as a response to Covid and national lockdowns I spent more time on my land.
The landscape in the Colden Valley is stunning and it was very rewarding establishing a
new veg patch and cut flower garden. After having initially been furloughed from my job
as a Gardening Coach followed by my contract ending during the lockdown I began to
think about the possibilities of earning a living wage from the land, hence the idea of a
small plant nursery began to grow.

Growing and propagating perennial plants on site means that they are acclimatised to
our local conditions, are reasonably priced, and have a significantly lower carbon
footprint than imported plants.
