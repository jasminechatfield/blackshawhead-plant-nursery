title: "Perennial Plants ðŸŒ¼"

Blackshawhead Plant Nursery specialise in â€˜hardy herbaceous perennialsâ€™. This means that the
plants die down in the winter but come back year after year when Spring arrives, forming a
bigger clump and are leafy with loads of flowers (rather than woody like shrubs). They can all
handle snow and freezing conditions.

The plants suit a naturalistic and informal style of planting. Many of the plants look like really
fancy weeds and look brilliant planted together in an ad hoc fashion with the different plants
flowering at different times through Spring, Summer and Autumn. The variety of plants available
ensure that colour and interest continues throughout the growing season, which is especially
good for bees. All plants can be grown in containers and pots, therefore a lack of a
conventional garden need not be an obstacle to having a riot of colourful plants in your
back-yard.

The plants have been grown in Blackshawhead either from tiny plug plants purchased
wholesale from Lincolnshire during the winter, or propagated from existing stock from seed or by
dividing an existing large plant into several small ones. As the residual stock expands so will the
range of plants propagated on site. I am particularly keen on plants that attract bees and
beneficial insects.
