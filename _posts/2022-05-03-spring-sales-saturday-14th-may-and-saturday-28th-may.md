title: Spring Sales! CANCELLED due to Covid

---

Unfortunately, the upcoming plant sale has been cancelled due to falling ill with the Coronavirus.

Sorry to disappoint at short notice. To be re-arranged for a future date. 

Grand Plant Sale!

Come and check out the full selection of plants growing at the nursery. Prices start at £2 for small specimens through to £10 for large plants in 5 litre pots.

All plants should at least double in size this season, once they have been planted in the garden or container.

New Road is just below the New Delight pub. A large sign at Jack Bridge will direct you to the plant sale.

Cash only please.

I can also be found at Hebden Bridge Farmers Market every Sunday, 9am - 4pm.
