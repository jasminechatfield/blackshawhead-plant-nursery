The trees are all Nordmann Fir, chosen for their excellent needle retention properties and lush full appearance. The seedlings were obtained from Inverness, Scotland and have been grown in Blackshawhead for the last 8/9 years. In addition to cut trees, living pot grown trees are also available. As a result of growing in a pot the growth rate is much slower and although each tree is around 8 years old the size ranges from 2.5ft - 4ft and prices start from Â£35.

### Sustainability

It may feel intrinsically wrong to cut down a perfectly good tree just for fun. However, because we enjoy having a real tree in our homes a reason is created for growing them which has a beneficial knock-on effect in two ways. The trees have helped in the absorption of carbon monoxide which is vital in slowly down climate breakdown, in addition to slowing the flow of water into the valley bottom thereby contributing to mitigating the disastrous effects of local flooding. As each tree is cut a new one is planted and so the cycle continues. As the trees are locally grown the only carbon footprint is the distance driven from Blackshawhead to your home. You can therefore feel smug that you are supporting a highly sustainable local enterprise which also benefits our environment!
